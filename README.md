# About Rhyme Me
Rhyme me is a rap assistant, you basically speak into the mic and you get a list of words that rhyme with the last thing you said.
[Try it out](https://rhymeme.herokuapp.com/)
# How Does it work?
## The FrontEnd
The react app uses a voice recognition AI, transcripts what you say and gets the last word and sends it to the api in a GET request
## The backend
The ASP.NET Api then takes that word and scrapes the web for words rhyming with it and sends back a list of that words that is then displayed to the user
### Endpoints
The project consists of a single endpoint
localhost:5001/api/rhymes/{keyword}
the keyword is the word you want results to rhyme with
# How Do I run it?
First download .NET sdk, runtime and ASP.NET (hosting bundle is preferred for windows users) from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
then on terminal run this command
`dotnet watch run`
I use SSR so running the API is enough, to test it.
if you wish to edit the frontEnd, which I don't recommend because I didn't take a react course or anything before this and the course is a hell of a mess, then edit it, and run `npm run`
Note: your api should be running for the react app to work

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
